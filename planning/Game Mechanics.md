## Character System

The monastery is not "the player" - the abbot is.
Abbey management is influenced by the abbot's traits, decisions, and tenure.
The abbot it mortal - new abbots may succeed previous ones, potentially changing monastery policies or goals.

## How This Affects Game Design

### Character System for Abbots
- Each abbot could have traits (e.g., Charitable, Strict, Scholarly).
- Traits affect decisions and how monks respond to leadership.
- Abbots could have skill levels (e.g., Administration, Theology).
- Aging and passing leadership to a successor creates long-term strategy.

### Abbey Politics & Decisions
- Players may need to balance relationships with monks, bishops, or secular rulers.
- Decisions could involve church doctrines, monastery expansions, or diplomacy.
- Some abbots may be more spiritual, others more pragmatic.

### Historical/Realism Considerations
- Does the game have historical inspirations (e.g., Benedictine rule)?
- Will there be interaction with the wider Church or rulers?
- Can abbots be removed by external forces (e.g., corruption, papal intervention)?

## Abbot Trait System

Every abbot will have traits that influence gameplay, much like CK2. These traits can be:

#### Example Traits

|Trait     |Effect on Monastery                                     |Example Consequences|
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------
|Charitable|Monks are happier; recruits join faster                 |+10% monk happiness, +5% donations       
|Scholarly |Faster book production and knowledge spread             |+15% learning spread, increased influence in Church
|Strict    |Increases monastery discipline but lowers monk happiness|+10% resource efficiency, -5% monk morale
|Greedy    |Higher wealth but lower reputation with Church          |+20% gold from donations, higher chance of conflict
|Zealous   |Boosts faith but may cause doctrinal disputes           |+10% faith influence, increased risk of heresy
|Diplomatic|Better relations with nobles and Church                 |+10% favour from Church and local lords
|Sickly    |Shorter lifespan                                        |Abbot may die younger, leading to more succession crises
|Visionary |Encourages innovation and new monastery policies        |Unlocks special monastery reforms


#### How Are Traits Assigned?

- Random at start of tenure (with some weighted by previous abbotâ€™s rule).
- Some may develop over time based on decisions.
- Events can add or remove traits (e.g., "A monk accuses the abbot of greed" â†’ Gain Greedy trait?).

## Abbot Governance Mechanics

### Election or Appointment System
- Is the abbot elected by monks or appointed by a bishop/pope?
- Elections could have different candidates with varied skills.
- Political intrigue: Nobles and church officials might interfere.

### Monastery Rules & Policies
Abbots can set policies affecting how the monastery runs:

|Policy|Effect|
|------|------|
|Strict Silence Rule|Monks work harder but happiness drops|
|Open Doors to Pilgrims|Increases income but brings more outside influence|
|Scribe Focus|More books copied, boosting monastery renown|
|Self-Sufficiency Mandate|Less reliance on outside donations, but slower growth|
