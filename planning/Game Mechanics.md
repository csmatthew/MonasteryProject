# Game Mechanics

## Character System

The monastery is not "the player" - the abbot is.
Abbey management is influenced by the abbot's traits, decisions, and tenure.
The abbot it mortal - new abbots may succeed previous ones, potentially changing monastery policies or goals.

## How This Affects Game Design

### Character System for Abbots
- Each abbot could have traits (e.g., Charitable, Strict, Scholarly).
- Traits affect decisions and how monks respond to leadership.
- Abbots could have skill levels (e.g., Administration, Theology).
- Aging and passing leadership to a successor creates long-term strategy.

### Abbey Politics & Decisions
- Players may need to balance relationships with monks, bishops, or secular rulers.
- Decisions could involve church doctrines, monastery expansions, or diplomacy.
- Some abbots may be more spiritual, others more pragmatic.

### Historical/Realism Considerations
- Does the game have historical inspirations (e.g., Benedictine rule)?
- Will there be interaction with the wider Church or rulers?
- Can abbots be removed by external forces (e.g., corruption, papal intervention)?

## Abbot Trait System

Every abbot will have traits that influence gameplay, much like CK2. These traits can be:
